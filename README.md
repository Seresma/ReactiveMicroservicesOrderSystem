# ReactiveMicroservicesOrderSystem
 ReactiveMicroservicesOrderSystem is a microservices-based application designed to handle order registration in a reactive environment. The system is composed of three main microservices:  Order Service: Responsible for processing and recording user orders. User Service: Manages user data and interactions related to orders. Product Service: Handles the available products that can be ordered. Each microservice communicates asynchronously and is built to scale efficiently in distributed environments, ensuring smooth integration and performance.
